# DotShopPlatform Frontend

This directory contains the frontend component of the DotShopPlatform, a user interface built primarily for testing the functionalities of the backend services. The frontend is designed with simplicity in mind, providing a straightforward and intuitive user experience for demonstrating the core features of the e-commerce platform.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.
- **Product Browsing**: View a list of products by brands.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add items to the cart and manage them.
- **Order Confirmation**: Review and confirm the order details.
- **Send Order**: Once the Order is confirmed, the Order is sent to the Database for processing.

## Technologies

- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- **Vue.js**: The progressive JavaScript framework used for building the user interface.
- **PrimeVue**: A rich UI component library for Vue.js.

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `dotshopplatform-frontend` directory.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Usage

The frontend is connected to the backend API and can perform all operations required to demonstrate the user flow of an e-commerce application, from signing up to finalizing an order.

## Note

While the frontend serves the purpose of demonstrating the platform's capabilities, it is not a production-ready application. It is intended to provide a visual and interactive means to showcase the backend's functionality.
